INFO:__main__:(EnumerationVsInheritanceConfiguration) Question 1:
There are different times of day: day and night. Do these times of day have distinct characteristics or requirements?
For example:
1. Day and night are considered different times of day, allowing for distinct details for each time of day.
2. Every play time of day is classified as either day or night. Both times of day have the same details, and there’s no need for extra information.

Which option is better for you?

INFO:__main__:(ClassVsAttributeConfiguration) Question 3:
We know that each musical has a time. When we think about time, is it just a simple piece of information, like a line of text? 
Or is time made up of different parts that might be important?
For example:
1. For each time, the detail information is saved separately, so users can filter musical by detail.
2. The time is a single piece of text. This works well when we just need to show the time.

Which option is better for you?

INFO:__main__:(ConcreteVsAbstractClassConfiguration) Question 6:
When we talk about people, do we always have a clear idea of a specific example, or do we sometimes speak about it in a more general way? Should we think of Person as a general concept that covers all possible forms, or is it always tied to a particular type or instance?

For example:
1. A general person can exist that is not an author or participant.
2. A person is just a concept and cannot exist on its own. We only need specific types like author or participant.
